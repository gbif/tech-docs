## Issues and flags

More than *50 issues and flags* have been created to deal with common
data quality problems. The following *long* section compiles all of them
and offers a more clear description of each one. This section is
intended to serve as a placeholder until more formal documentation can
be written.

.Geospatial issues
|===
|Flag name | Definition | Terms | Example

|*Zero coordinate*
|Coordinates are exactly 0/0, often indicating an actual null coordinate.  
|_dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude_ 
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=ZERO_COORDINATE[example]

|*Coordinate out of range*  
|The supplied coordinates lie outside of the range for decimal lat/lon values (-90/90, -180/180).
|_dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude, dwc:verbatimCoordinates, dwc:verbatimLatitude, dwc:verbatimLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_OUT_OF_RANGE[example] 

|*Country coordinate mismatch*
|The interpreted occurrence coordinates fall outside of the indicated country. 
|_dwc:countryCode, dwc:country, dwc:decimalLatitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH[example] 

|*Coordinate invalid* 
|A coordinate value is given in some form, but GBIF is unable to interpret it. Possible reasons include, i.a., coordinates that fall out of range(larger/lower than 90/-90 or 180/-180, depending) or text values that cannot be interpreted.
|_dwc:decimalLatitude,dwc:decimalLongitude, dwc:verbatimCoordinates, dwc:verbatimLatitude,dwc:verbatimLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_INVALID[example]

|*Geodetic datum assumed WGS84* 
|If the datum is null, data interpretation assumes the record coordinates are in WGS84.
|_dwc:geodeticDatum_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=GEODETIC_DATUM_ASSUMED_WGS84[example]

|*Geodetic datum invalid* 
|The geodetic datum could not be interpreted, because the supplied term cannot be matched against the vocabulary of known values.
|_dwc:geodeticDatum_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=GEODETIC_DATUM_INVALID[example] +

|*Country mismatch* 
|Interpreted Country and Country code contradict each other.
|_dwc:countryCode, dwc:country_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COUNTRY_MISMATCH[example]

|*Country derived from coordinates* 
|If the country and country code are not supplied or cannot be matched to known values, data interpretation derives their content from the decimal coordinates through a https://github.com/gbif/geocode[lookup service].
|_dwc:countryCode, dwc:country, dwc:decimalLatitude,dwc:decimalLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COUNTRY_DERIVED_FROM_COORDINATES[example]

|_dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_ROUNDED[example]

|*Coordinate reprojected*
|The original coordinates were successfully reprojected from a different geodetic datum to WGS84.
|_dwc:geodeticDatum_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_REPROJECTED[example]

|*Coordinate reprojection suspicious*

|_dwc:geodeticDatum, dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_REPROJECTION_SUSPICIOUS[example]

|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_REPROJECTION_FAILED[example]

|_dwc:coordinateUncertaintyInMeters_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_UNCERTAINTY_METERS_INVALID[example]

|_dwc:coordinatePrecision_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_PRECISION_INVALID[example]

|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=PRESUMED_NEGATED_LONGITUDE[example]

|*Presumed negated latitude* 
|The supplied latitude value places the coordinates outside of the indicated country. Negating the latitude value would result in a country match.

|Multiple institutions were found in |https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll[GRSciColl] with the same level of confidence and it can't be determined which one should be accepted. For example, there are several institutions with the same code and country.

|*Institution match none*
|No match was found in |https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll[GRSciColl]. Either the entry doesn't exists in GRSciColl or it has a different code. Check https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll[GRSciColl] and request update if needed.

|*Institution match fuzzy*
|A match was found in https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll[GRSciColl] but it was matched fuzzily. To know more about why this has happened you can use the https://www.gbif.org/developer/registry#lookup[lookup API] to see see the "reasons" returned in the response. A common case is when the name is used instead of the code or the identifier. To avoid fuzzy matches, publishers should use identifiers in additon to codes.
