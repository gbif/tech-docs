## Issues and flags

More than *50 issues and flags* have been created to deal with common
data quality problems. The following *long* section compiles all of them
and offers a more clear description of each one. This section is
intended to serve as a placeholder until more formal documentation can
be written.

.Geospatial issues
|===
|Flag name | Definition | Terms | Example

|*Zero coordinate*
|Coordinates are exactly 0/0, often indicating an actual null coordinate.  
|_dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude_ 
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=ZERO_COORDINATE[example]

|*Coordinate out of range*  
|The supplied coordinates lie outside of the range for decimal lat/lon values (-90/90, -180/180).
|_dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude, dwc:verbatimCoordinates, dwc:verbatimLatitude, dwc:verbatimLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_OUT_OF_RANGE[example] 

|*Country coordinate mismatch*
|The interpreted occurrence coordinates fall outside of the indicated country. 
|_dwc:countryCode, dwc:country, dwc:decimalLatitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH[example] 

|*Coordinate invalid* 
|A coordinate value is given in some form, but GBIF is unable to interpret it. Possible reasons include, i.a., coordinates that fall out of range(larger/lower than 90/-90 or 180/-180, depending) or text values that cannot be interpreted.
|_dwc:decimalLatitude,dwc:decimalLongitude, dwc:verbatimCoordinates, dwc:verbatimLatitude,dwc:verbatimLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_INVALID[example]

|*Geodetic datum assumed WGS84* 
|If the datum is null, data interpretation assumes the record coordinates are in WGS84.
|_dwc:geodeticDatum_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=GEODETIC_DATUM_ASSUMED_WGS84[example]

|*Geodetic datum invalid* 
|The geodetic datum could not be interpreted, because the supplied term cannot be matched against the vocabulary of known values.
|_dwc:geodeticDatum_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=GEODETIC_DATUM_INVALID[example] +

|*Country mismatch* 
|Interpreted Country and Country code contradict each other.
|_dwc:countryCode, dwc:country_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COUNTRY_MISMATCH[example]

|*Country derived from coordinates* 
|If the country and country code are not supplied or cannot be matched to known values, data interpretation derives their content from the decimal coordinates through a https://github.com/gbif/geocode[lookup service].
|_dwc:countryCode, dwc:country, dwc:decimalLatitude,dwc:decimalLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COUNTRY_DERIVED_FROM_COORDINATES[example]

|In the data interpretation the original coordinates are rounded to 6 decimals (~1m precision).
|_dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_ROUNDED[example]

|*Coordinate reprojected*
|The original coordinates were successfully reprojected from a different geodetic datum to WGS84.
|_dwc:geodeticDatum_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_REPROJECTED[example]

|*Coordinate reprojection suspicious*

|_dwc:geodeticDatum, dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_REPROJECTION_SUSPICIOUS[example]

|_dwc:geodeticDatum,dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_REPROJECTION_FAILED[example]

|*Coordinate uncertainty meters invalid*
|The value given for Coordinate uncertainty in meters, indicating the radius of uncertainty around the given decimal coordinates, is not a valid number, or lies outside a plausible range.
|_dwc:coordinateUncertaintyInMeters_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_UNCERTAINTY_METERS_INVALID[example]

|*Coordinate precision invalid*

|_dwc:coordinatePrecision_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_PRECISION_INVALID[example]

|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=PRESUMED_NEGATED_LONGITUDE[example]

|*Presumed negated latitude* 
|The supplied latitude value places the coordinates outside of the indicated country. Negating the latitude value would result in a country match.
|_dwc:decimalLatitude_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=PRESUMED_NEGATED_LATITUDE[example]

|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=DEPTH_NOT_METRIC[example]

|*Elevation non numeric* 
|The values for minimum and maximum elevation are non-numeric values and cannot be interpreted.

name is used instead of the code or the identifier. To avoid fuzzy
matches, publishers should use identifiers in additon to codes. More
