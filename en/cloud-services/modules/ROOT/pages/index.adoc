Every month GBIF takes a full occurrence snapshot and uploads it to three cloud computing data repositories:

* the https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/gbif[Microsoft Planetary Computer] for Microsoft Azure
* as an https://registry.opendata.aws/gbif/[Amazon AWS Open Dataset]
* and to a public https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/public-datasets-gbif[Google GCS bucket] and https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/gbif-occurrences[BigQuery table].

Information on the latest available snapshot is shown on https://www.gbif.org/occurrence-snapshots[Occurrence Snapshots], including a DOI and advice on https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines#derivedDatasets[Derived Dataset citations] for the records used.

The Azure, AWS and GCS pages linked above include some advice and tutorials.  Users unfamiliar with cloud services should also see these posts from the GBIF Data Blog:

* https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/aws-and-gbif/[GBIF and Apache-Spark on AWS tutorial]
* https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/microsoft-azure-and-gbif/[GBIF and Apache-Spark on Microsoft Azure tutorial]

The easiest service to use for rapid access to data is the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/gbif-occurrences[Google BigQuery table], which provides an SQL-like interface to the data.  We have provided examples on the linked page.
