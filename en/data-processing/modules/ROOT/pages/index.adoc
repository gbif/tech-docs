Every single occurrence record in GBIF goes through a series of processing steps until it becomes available on GBIF.org.  The overall process is described on https://www.gbif.org/article/5i3CQEZ6DuWiycgMaaakCo/gbif-infrastructure-data-processing[GBIF.org].

More specific topics are listed in the section menu.
