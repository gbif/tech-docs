== Background to the GBIF Metadata Profile

____
Metadata describes and explains the context of a dataset, and can vary in completeness. In general, metadata should allow a prospective end user of data to:

1. Identify/discover its existence,
2. Learn how to access or acquire the data,
3. Understand its fitness-for-use, and
4. Learn how to transfer (obtain a copy of) the data.
____

The https://rs.gbif.org/schema/eml-gbif-profile/1.3/[GBIF EML Profile] was developed in order to standardize how resources get described at the dataset level in http://www.gbif.org[GBIF.org]. #This profile can be transformed to other common metadata formats.#

In the GBIF EML Profile there is a minimum set of mandatory elements required for identification, but it is recommended that as many elements be used as possible to ensure the metadata are as descriptive and complete as possible.

== Metadata Elements

The GBIF EML Profile is primarily based on the https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/[Ecological Metadata Language (EML)]. The GBIF profile utilizes a subset of EML and extends it to include additional requirements that are not accommodated in the EML specification. The following tables provide short descriptions of the profile elements, and where relevant, links to more complete EML descriptions. The elements are categorized as follows:

* Dataset (Resource)
* Project
* People and Organizations
* Keyword Set (General Keywords)
* Coverage
** Taxonomic Coverage
** Geographic Coverage
** Temporal Coverage
* Methods
* Intellectual Property Rights
* Additional Metadata + NCD (Natural Collections Descriptions Data) Related

=== Dataset (Resource)

The https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/eml-dataset_xsd#eml-dataset.xsd[dataset] field has elements relating to a single dataset (resource).

[%autowidth,stripes=hover] 
|===
| Term name | Description | Example

| https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/eml-resource_xsd#ResourceGroup_alternateIdentifier[alternateIdentifier] 
| It is a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the EML document and not for the dataset. This term is optional. A list of different identifiers can be supplied.

|===

=== People and Organizations

Several fields could represent either a person or an organization. Below is a list of the various fields used to describe a person or organization.

[%autowidth,stripes=hover] 
|===
| Term | Definition | Example

| https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/eml-party_xsd#Person_givenName[givenName] 
| Subfield of individualName field. The given name field can be used for the first name of the individual associated with the resource, or for any other names that are not intended to be alphabetized (as appropriate). 
| Jonny

| https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/eml-party_xsd#Person_surName[surName]

| Carson

| https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/eml-party_xsd#ResponsibleParty_organizationName[organizationName] 
| The full name of the organization that is associated with the resource. This field is intended to describe which institution or overall organization is associated with the resource being described. 
| National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis

| https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/eml-party_xsd#ResponsibleParty_positionName[positionName]
| This field is intended to be used instead of a particular person or full organization name. If the associated person that holds the role changes frequently, then Position Name would be used for consistency. Note that this field, used in conjunction with 'organizationName' and 'individualName' make up a single logical originator. Because of this, an originator with only the individualName of 'Joe Smith' is NOT the same as an originator with the name of 'Joe Smith' and the organizationName of 'NSF'. Also, the positionName should not be used in conjunction with individualName unless only that individual at that position would be considered an originator for the data package. If a positionName is used in conjunction with an organizationName, then that implies that any person who currently occupies said positionName at organizationName is the originator of the data package. 
| HAST herbarium data manager

E.g. technician, reviewer, principal investigator, etc. #NB: should this instead be https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/eml-project_xsd#ResearchProjectType_ResearchProjectType_personnel_role[role]? Neither have a matching description to the original entry#
|

| jgtiCuratorialUnit
a| A quantitative descriptor (number of specimens, samples or batches). The actual quantification could be covered by

. an exact number of “JGI-units” in the collection plus a measure of uncertainty (± x);
. a range of numbers (x to x), with the lower value representing an exact number, when the higher value is omitted.

The discussion concluded that the quantification should encompass all specimens, not only those that have not yet been digitized. This is to avoid having to update the numbers too often. The number of non-public data (not digitized or not accessible) can be calculated from the GBIF numbers as opposed to the JGTI-data.
