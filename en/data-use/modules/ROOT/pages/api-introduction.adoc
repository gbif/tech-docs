= Introduction to the GBIF API

The GBIF API provides a programmatic way to query and publish data on GBIF.org. It can be useful or necessary to use the API to

* make advanced queries, not supported by the website,
* include the results of GBIF queries in scripts, workflows or analyses, which can then be repeated reliably and automatically,
* embed GBIF data into other websites.

It can be accessed using any programming language, from a command-line terminal interface, or in some cases using a web browser.

Beginners can refer to the https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-api-beginners-guide/[GBIF API Beginner's Guide] on the GBIF data blog.

Complete documentation is available in the xref:openapi::index.adoc[API Reference] section.
