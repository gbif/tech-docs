= Data cubes

NOTE: This is an **experimental feature**, and the implementation may change throughout 2024.  The feature is currently only available for preview by invited users.

*Data cubes* group species occurrence data along spatial, temporal and/or taxonomic dimensions.

They can be produced using a *prototype* GBIF API, or using the GBIF occurrence data deposited on xref:cloud-services::index.adoc[external cloud services].  This page covers generating a cube using GBIF's API.  See xref:b-cubed:generate-cube-databricks.adoc[] to generate a cube using a public cloud service.

== Demonstration cube specification

The guides below will produce a data cube for occurrences of animals from Poland, recorded during or after 2000.

The _dimensions_ of the cube will be

. Species
** We must therefore exclude occurrences not identified to species level
** We will also exclude occurrences with known uncertain identifications
. Year-Month
** We must exclude occurrences with only year accuracy, or with an uncertain date spanning multiple months
. EEA Reference grid
** We will randomize the point using the coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, defaulting to 1000m
** We will exclude occurrences without coordinates
. Sex
** This is included to demonstrate a basic dimension
. Life stage
** This is included to demonstrate a more complex field (a vocabulary field) used for a dimension

The _measures_ of the cube will be

. Occurrence count
. Minimum coordinate uncertainty
. Minimum temporal uncertainty

=== Create an initial GBIF search filter

Perhaps using the GBIF.org website, find an approximate search filter, for example for a particular taxon, country or region, year range, etc.  This will need to be expressed in SQL for submission to the API:

[source,sql]
----
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL' <1>
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdomKey = 1 <2>
  AND hasCoordinate = TRUE <3>
----
<1> Poland
<2> _Animalia_
<3> Include only occurrences with coordinates

=== Exclude unwanted data

The GBIF website and search APIs do not allow excluding data from searches, but this is often required for data cubes.  We add additional expressions to our WHERE clause:

[source,sql]
----
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL <1>
  AND NOT array_contains(issue, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH') <2>
  AND month IS NOT NULL <3>
----
<1> Exclude occurrences not identified to species level
<2> Exclude occurrences with this georeferencing issue
<3> Exclude occurrences without a month, or spanning multiple months

=== Write full query

The WHERE clause is the filter, but the dimensions and measurements must be defined.  These are used for the SELECT and GROUPÂ BY clauses.

Typical data cubes will use an SQL query similar to this one:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT <1>
  -- Dimensions: <2>
  "year", <3>
  GBIF_EEARGCode(
    1000,
    decimalLatitude,
    decimalLongitude,
    COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000) <4>
  ) AS eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  COALESCE(sex, 'NOT_SUPPLIED') AS sex,
  COALESCE(occurrence.lifestage.concept, 'NOT_SUPPLIED') AS lifestage,
  -- Measurements <5>
  COUNT(*) AS occurrences, <6>
  MIN(COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000)) AS minCoordinateUncertaintyInMeters
FROM
  occurrence
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL'
  AND "year" >= 2000
  AND kingdomKey = 1
  AND hasCoordinate = TRUE
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND "month" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  "year",
  eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  sex,
  lifestage
ORDER BY <7>
  "year" DESC,
  eeaCellCode ASC,
  speciesKey ASC;
----
<1> These are the columns in the resulting cube, i.e. the dimensions and measurements for the cube.
<2> The dimensions must also appear in the `GROUP BY` section. They can include functions.
<3> `YEAR` (or `year`) is an SQL function, so we must quote the name of the column as `"year"`.  The same for `"month"`.
<4> `COALESCE` sets a default value (1000) if the first value is absent.
<5> The measurements must be SQL aggregate functions, like `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVERAGE`, `SUM` etc
<6> `AS` gives a name to the column, used as the header in the result file
<7> The `ORDER BY` section is optional.

See xref::api-sql-download-functions.adoc[] for descriptions and arguments for the functions, including the `GBIF_EEARGCode` (EEA reference grid) function.

=== Submit the query to GBIF

See xref::api-sql-downloads.adoc[] for instructions.

A cube using this query is available https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download/0000338-240229165702484[here].
