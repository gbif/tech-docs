NOTE: This is an **experimental feature**, and the implementation may change throughout 2024.  The feature is currently available for preview on the GBIF test environment, https://www.gbif-uat.org/[GBIF-UAT.org].

*Data cubes* group species occurrence data along spatial, temporal and/or taxonomic dimensions.

They can be produced using a *prototype* GBIF API, or using the GBIF occurrence data deposited on xref:cloud-services::index.adoc[external cloud services].  Both methods are described on this page.

== Demonstration cube specification

The guides below will produce a data cube for occurrences of animals from Poland, recorded during or after 2000.

The _dimensions_ of the cube will be

. Species
** We must therefore exclude occurrences not identified to species level
** We will also exclude occurrences with known uncertain identifications
. Year-Month
** We must exclude occurrences with only year accuracy, or with an uncertain date spanning multiple months
. EEA Reference grid
** We will randomize the point using the coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, defaulting to 1000m
** We will exclude occurrences without coordinates
. Sex
** This is included to demonstrate a basic dimension
. Life stage
** This is included to demonstrate a more complex field (a vocabulary field) used for a dimension

The _measures_ of the cube will be

. Occurrence count
. Minimum coordinate uncertainty
. Minimum temporal uncertainty

== Generating a data cube using the GBIF API

=== Create an initial GBIF search filter

Perhaps using the GBIF.org website, find an approximate search filter, for example for a particular taxon, country or region, year range, etc.  This will need to be expressed in SQL for submission to the API:

[source,sql]
----
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL' <1>
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdomKey = 1 <2>
  AND hasCoordinate = TRUE <3>
----
<1> Poland
<2> _Animalia_
<3> Include only occurrences with coordinates

=== Exclude unwanted data

The GBIF website and search APIs do not allow excluding data from searches, but this is often required for data cubes.  We add additional expressions to our WHERE clause:

[source,sql]
----
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL <1>
  AND NOT array_contains(issue, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH') <2>
  AND month IS NOT NULL <3>
----
<1> Exclude occurrences not identified to species level
<2> Exclude occurrences with this georeferencing issue
<3> Exclude occurrences without a month, or spanning multiple months

=== Write full query

The WHERE clause is the filter, but the dimensions and measurements must be defined.  These are used for the SELECT and GROUPÂ BY clauses.

Typical data cubes will use an SQL query similar to this one:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT <1>
  -- Dimensions: <2>
  "year", <3>
  GBIF_EEARGCode(
    1000,
    decimalLatitude,
    decimalLongitude,
    COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000) <4>
  ) AS eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  sex,
  lifestage.concept AS lifestage,
  -- Measurements <5>
  COUNT(*) AS n, <6>
  MIN(COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000)) AS minCoordinateUncertaintyInMeters
FROM
  occurrence
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL'
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdomKey = 1
  AND hasCoordinate = TRUE
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND "month" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  "year",
  eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  sex,
  lifestage.concept,
ORDER BY <7>
  year DESC,
  eeaCellCode ASC,
  speciesKey ASC;
----
<1> These are the columns in the resulting cube, i.e. the dimensions and measurements for the cube.
<2> The dimensions must also appear in the `GROUP BY` section. They can include functions.
<3> `YEAR` (or `year`) is an SQL function, so we must quote the name of the column as `"year"`.  The same for `"month"`.
<4> `COALESCE` sets a default value (1000) if the first value is absent.
<5> The measurements must be SQL aggregate functions, like `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVERAGE`, `SUM` etc
<6> `AS` gives a name to the column, used as the header in the result file
<7> The `ORDER BY` section is optional.

See xref::api-sql-download-functions.adoc[] for descriptions and arguments for the functions, including the `GBIF_EEARGCode` (EEA reference grid) function.

=== Submit the query to GBIF

See xref::api-sql-downloads.adoc[] for instructions.

== Generating a data cube using Microsoft Azure Databricks

NOTE: This is a **prototype**, and the implementation may change throughout 2024.

=== Set up the Databricks cluster

Follow the guide on the GBIF Data Blog, https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/microsoft-azure-and-gbif/[GBIF and Apache-Spark on Microsoft Azure tutorial], to set up a Databricks cluster.

Once the "Compute" cluster is created, add the cube functions library.

. Choose "Compute", select your cluster and then "Libraries"
. Click "Install new", "Maven" and use these parameters:
** Coordinates: `org.gbif.occurrence:cube-hive:0.1.0`
** Repository: `https://repository.gbif.org/content/repositories/releases`
. Click "Install"

=== Import the most recent GBIF monthly snapshot

Create a new notebook, and using a Scala cell run this code. (Change the date to the current month.)

[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

val gbif_snapshot_path = "wasbs://gbif@ai4edataeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/occurrence/2024-02-01/occurrence.parquet/*"

val df = spark.read.parquet(gbif_snapshot_path)

spark.sql("CREATE DATABASE gbif")

df.write.format("parquet").saveAsTable("gbif.occurrence")
----

=== Create a new SQL notebook

In another new notebook, add an SQL cell and define the grid functions:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FUNCTION eeaCellCode AS 'org.gbif.occurrence.hive.udf.EeaCellCodeUDF';
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FUNCTION eqdgcCode AS 'org.gbif.occurrence.hive.udf.ExtendedQuarterDegreeGridCellCodeUDF';
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FUNCTION mgrsCode AS 'org.gbif.occurrence.hive.udf.MilitaryGridReferenceSystemCellCodeUDF';
----

=== Create an initial GBIF search filter

Perhaps using the GBIF.org website, find an approximate search filter, for example for a particular taxon, country or region, year range, etc.  This will need to be expressed in SQL for submission to the API:

[source,sql]
----
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL'
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdom = 'Animalia' <1>
----
<1> The `kingdomKey` fields (used in the GBIF API version above) is not available on Azure

Note that not all fields are available on the GBIF data snapshot in Microsoft Azure.

=== Exclude unwanted data

The GBIF website and search APIs do not allow excluding data from searches, but this is often required for data cubes.  We have additional expressions for our WHERE clause:

[source,sql]
----
  AND decimalLatitude IS NOT NULL <1>
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT array_contains(issue, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND month IS NOT NULL
----
<1> The `hasCoordinate` fields is not available on Azure

=== Write full query

Typical data cubes will use an SQL query similar to this one:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT <1>
  -- Dimensions: <2>
  year,
  GBIF_EEARGCode(
    1000,
    decimalLatitude,
    decimalLongitude,
    COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000) <3>
  ) AS eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  sex,
  lifestage.concept AS lifestage,
  -- Measurements <4>
  COUNT(*) AS n, <5>
  MIN(COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000)) AS minCoordinateUncertaintyInMeters
FROM
  gbif.occurrence
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL'
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdom = 'Animalia'
  AND decimalLatitude IS NOT NULL
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND month IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  year,
  eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  sex,
  lifestage.concept,
ORDER BY <6>
  year DESC,
  eeaCellCode ASC,
  speciesKey ASC;
