== Media displayed on the GBIF portal

The GBIF.org portal allows to look for occurrences associated with media. For example, [pictures of otters](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?media_type=StillImage&taxon_key=2433753), or the [call of a sea eagle](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?media_type=Sound&taxon_key=2480444).

Anyone can filter [GBIF occurrences](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search) by Media Type. Once users find what they are looking for, they can see and/or hear it directly on the GBIF portal.

==== Images

GBIF's searching interface has a [gallery](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/gallery), which displays the first image available for each occurrence selected.

Users can also view images for a particular occurrence, by simply clicking on it. See for example, this [occurrence with two images](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1822411383) from [the Norwegian Species Observation Service](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/b124e1e0-4755-430f-9eab-894f25a9b59c).

All the images belonging to a single dataset are visible on [its page](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/b124e1e0-4755-430f-9eab-894f25a9b59c). The same goes for all the images belonging to datasets published under the same organization: see [this example](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/d3978a37-635a-4ae3-bb85-7b4d41bc0b88).

==== Audio and Video

Sounds and videos can be directly played from a given occurrence page through a media player.

For example, by clicking on [this occurrence](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1934990970) from [Xeno-canto - Bird sounds from around the world](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/b1047888-ae52-4179-9dd5-5448ea342a24), users can listen to a kookaburra call.

Here are some videos showing the 3D reconstruction of a specimen of sand flea by clicking on [this occurrence](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/863580710) from [the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/4bfac3ea-8763-4f4b-a71a-76a6f5f243d3)
