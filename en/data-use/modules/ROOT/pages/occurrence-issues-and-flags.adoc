= Occurrence issues and flags

More than *60 issues and flags* have been created to deal with common data quality problems.  Data users may use these flags to exclude occurrences from their analysis, or to apply their own data quality checks.

// The definitive list of flags in in the API, and can be seen in the source code:
// https://github.com/gbif/gbif-api/blob/dev/src/main/java/org/gbif/api/vocabulary/OccurrenceIssue.java

// Check for missing issues:

== Taxonomic issues

[cols="20%,60%,10%,10%"]
|===
|Flag name | Definition | Terms | Example

|*Taxon match higherrank*
a|The record can be matched to the GBIF taxonomic backbone at a higher rank, but not with the scientific name given.

Reasons include:

* The name is new, and not available in the taxonomic datasets yet
* The name is missing in the backbone's taxonomic sources for others reasons
* Formatting or spelling of the scientific name caused interpretation errors
|_dwc:scientificName, dwc:kingdom, dwc:phylum, dwc:class, dwc:order, dwc:family, dwc:genus, dwc:subgenus, dwc:specificEpithet, dwc:infraspecificEpithet, dwc:taxonRank_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_HIGHERRANK[example]

|*Taxon match none*
|Matching to the taxonomic backbone cannot be done cause there was no match at all or several matches with too little information to keep them apart(homonyms).
|_dwc:scientificName, dwc:kingdom, dwc:phylum, dwc:class, dwc:order, dwc:family, dwc:genus, dwc:subgenus, dwc:specificEpithet, dwc:infraspecificEpithet, dwc:taxonRank_
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_NONE[example]

|*Taxon match fuzzy*
|Matching to the taxonomic backbone can only be done using a fuzzy, non exact match.
|dwc:scientificName, dwc:kingdom, dwc:phylum, dwc:class, dwc:order, dwc:family, dwc:genus, dwc:subgenus, dwc:specificEpithet, dwc:infraspecificEpithet, dwc:taxonRank
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_FUZZY[example]

|*Taxon match aggregate*
|Matching to the taxonomic backbone can only be done on a species level, but the occurrence was considered a broader species aggregate or complex.
|dwc:scientificName, dwc:kingdom, dwc:phylum, dwc:class, dwc:order, dwc:family, dwc:genus, dwc:subgenus, dwc:specificEpithet, dwc:infraspecificEpithet, dwc:taxonRank
|https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_AGGREGATE[example]

|*Scientific name and ID inconsistent*
|The scientificName provided in the occurrence record does not precisely match the name in the registered checklist when using the scientificNameID, taxonID or taxonConceptID to look it up. Publishers are advised to check the IDs are correct, or update the formatting of the names on their records.
|dwc:scientificName,dwc:scientificNameID,dwc:taxonID,dwc:taxonConceptID
|[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=SCIENTIFIC_NAME_AND_ID_INCONSISTENT)

|*Taxon match name and ID ambiguous*
|The GBIF Backbone concept was found using the scientificNameID, taxonID or taxonConceptID, but it differs from what would have been found if the classification names on the record were used. This may indicate a gap in the GBIF backbone, a poor mapping between the checklist and the backbone, or a mismatch between the classification names and the declared IDs (scientificNameID or taxonConceptID) on the occurrence record itself.
|dwc:scientificName,dwc:scientificNameID,dwc:taxonID,dwc:taxonConceptID
|[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_NAME_AND_ID_AMBIGUOUS)

|*Scientific name ID not found*
|The scientificNameID matched a known pattern, but it was not found in the associated checklist. The backbone lookup was performed using either the names or a different ID field from the record. This may indicate a poorly formatted identifier or may be caused by a newly created ID that isn't yet known in the version of the published checklist.
|dwc:scientificNameID
|[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=SCIENTIFIC_NAME_ID_NOT_FOUND)

|*Taxon concept ID not found*
|The taxonConceptID matched a known pattern, but it was not found in the associated checklist. The backbone lookup was performed using either the names or a different ID field from the record. This may indicate a poorly formatted identifier or may be caused by a newly created ID that isn't yet known in the version of the published checklist.
|dwc:taxonConceptID
|[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_CONCEPT_ID_NOT_FOUND)

|*Taxon ID not found*
|The taxonID found matched a known pattern, but it was not found in the associated checklist. The backbone lookup was performed using either the names or a different ID field from the record. This may indicate a poorly formatted identifier or may be caused by a newly created ID that isn't yet known in the version of the published checklist.
|dwc:taxonID
|[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_ID_NOT_FOUND)

|*Taxon match scientific name ID ignored*
|The scientificNameID was not used when mapping the record to the GBIF backbone. This may indicate one of: 

* The ID uses a pattern not configured for use by GBIF
* The ID did not uniquely identify a concept in the checklist
* The ID found a concept in the checklist that did not map to the backbone
* A different ID was used, or the record names were used, as no ID lookup successfully linked to the backbone.
|dwc:scientificNameID
|[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_SCIENTIFIC_NAME_ID_IGNORED)

|*Taxon match taxon concept ID ignored*
|taxonConceptID was not used when mapping the record to the GBIF backbone. This may indicate one of: 

* The ID uses a pattern not configured for use by GBIF
* The ID did not uniquely identify a concept in the checklist
* The ID found a concept in the checklist that did not map to the backbone
* A different ID was used, or the record names were used, as no ID lookup successfully linked to the backbone.
|dwc:taxonConceptID
|[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_TAXON_CONCEPT_ID_IGNORED)

|*Taxon match taxon ID ignored*
|The taxonID was not used when mapping the record to the GBIF backbone. This may indicate one of: 

* The ID uses a pattern not configured for use by GBIF
