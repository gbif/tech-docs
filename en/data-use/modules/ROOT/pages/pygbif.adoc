#TODO: Rewrite/write page, this is just a starter.#

_Python client for the GBIF API._

pygbif is split up into modules for each of the major GBIF API endpoints:

* Registry - Datasets, Nodes, Installations, Networks, Organizations
* Species - Taxonomic names
* Occurrences - Occurrence data, including the download API
* Maps - Maps, get raster maps from GBIF as PNG or MVT

You can import the entire library, or each module individually as needed.
