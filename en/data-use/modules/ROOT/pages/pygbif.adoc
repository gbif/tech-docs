= pygbif

_An interface to the GBIF API for the Python programming language._

**pygbif** is a Python package that allows searching and retrieving data from GBIF. pygbif wraps Python code around the xref:api-introduction.adoc[GBIF API] to allow you to talk to GBIF from Python and access metadata, species names, and occurrences.

The main pygbif documentation can be found at https://pygbif.readthedocs.io/.
