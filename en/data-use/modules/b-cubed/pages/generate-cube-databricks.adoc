= Generate a species occurrence cube using Microsoft Azure Databricks

*Species occurrence cubes* group species occurrence data along spatial, temporal and/or taxonomic dimensions.

This page demonstrates creating a cube using GBIF occurrence data deposited on Microsoft Azure.  The same approach can be used with other tabular data by uploading or importing it to Azure.

== Demonstration cube specification

The guide below will produce a data cube for occurrences of animals from Poland, recorded during or after 2000.

The _dimensions_ of the cube will be

. Species
** We must therefore exclude occurrences not identified to species level
** We will also exclude occurrences with known uncertain identifications
. Year-Month
** We must exclude occurrences with only year accuracy, or with an uncertain date spanning multiple months
. EEA Reference grid
** We will randomize the point using the coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, defaulting to 1000m
** We will exclude occurrences without coordinates

The _measures_ of the cube will be

. Occurrence count
. Minimum coordinate uncertainty
. Minimum temporal uncertainty

== Generating a data cube using Microsoft Azure Databricks

NOTE: This is a **prototype**, and the implementation may change throughout 2024.

=== Set up the Databricks cluster

Follow the guide on the GBIF Data Blog, https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/microsoft-azure-and-gbif/[GBIF and Apache-Spark on Microsoft Azure tutorial], to set up a Databricks cluster.

Once the "Compute" cluster is created, add the cube functions library.

. Choose "Compute", select your cluster and then "Libraries"
. Click "Install new", "Maven" and use these parameters:
** Coordinates: `org.gbif.occurrence:cube-hive:0.2.0`
** Repository: `https://repository.gbif.org/content/repositories/releases`
. Click "Install"

=== Import the most recent GBIF monthly snapshot

Create a new notebook, and using a Scala cell run this code. (Change the date to the first day of the current month.)

[source,scala]
----
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._

val gbif_snapshot_path = "wasbs://gbif@ai4edataeuwest.blob.core.windows.net/occurrence/2024-02-01/occurrence.parquet/*"

val df = spark.read.parquet(gbif_snapshot_path)

spark.sql("CREATE DATABASE gbif")

df.write.format("parquet").saveAsTable("gbif.occurrence")
----

=== Define the gridding functions

In another new notebook, add an SQL cell and define the grid functions:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FUNCTION eeaCellCode AS 'org.gbif.occurrence.hive.udf.EeaCellCodeUDF';
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FUNCTION eqdgcCode AS 'org.gbif.occurrence.hive.udf.ExtendedQuarterDegreeGridCellCodeUDF';
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FUNCTION mgrsCode AS 'org.gbif.occurrence.hive.udf.MilitaryGridReferenceSystemCellCodeUDF';
----

See xref:sql-cube-functions.adoc[] for definitions and parameters of the gridding functions.

=== Create an initial GBIF search filter

Perhaps using the GBIF.org website, find an approximate search filter, for example for a particular taxon, country or region, year range, etc.  This will need to be expressed in SQL for submission to the API:

[source,sql]
----
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL'
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdom = 'Animalia'
----

Note that not all fields are available on the GBIF data snapshot in Microsoft Azure.

=== Exclude unwanted data

The GBIF website and search APIs do not allow excluding data from searches, but this is often required for data cubes.  We have additional expressions for our WHERE clause:

[source,sql]
----
  AND decimalLatitude IS NOT NULL
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT array_contains(issue.array_element, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND month IS NOT NULL
----

=== Write full query

Typical data cubes will use an SQL query similar to this one:

// Notebook with this query: https://adb-3344466598970896.16.azuredatabricks.net/?o=3344466598970896#notebook/2739885278246418/command/2739885278246426

[source,sql]
----
SELECT <1>
  -- Dimensions: <2>
  CONCAT_WS('-', year, month) AS yearMonth,
  eeaCellCode(
    1000,
    decimalLatitude,
    decimalLongitude,
    COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000) <3>
  ) AS eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  species,
  -- Measurements <4>
  COUNT(*) AS n, <5>
  MIN(COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000)) AS minCoordinateUncertaintyInMeters
FROM
  gbif.occurrence
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL'
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdom = 'Animalia'
  AND decimalLatitude IS NOT NULL
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue.array_element, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND month IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  yearMonth,
  eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  species
ORDER BY <6>
  yearMonth DESC,
  eeaCellCode ASC,
  speciesKey ASC;
----
<1> These are the columns in the resulting cube, i.e. the dimensions and measurements for the cube.
<2> The dimensions must also appear in the `GROUP BY` section. They can include functions.
<3> `COALESCE` sets a default value (1000) if the first value is absent.
<4> The measurements must be SQL aggregate functions, like `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVERAGE`, `SUM` etc
<5> `AS` gives a name to the column, used as the header in the result file
<6> The `ORDER BY` section is optional.

See xref::sql-cube-functions.adoc[] for descriptions and arguments for the functions, including the `eeaCellCode` (EEA reference grid) function.

See xref:ROOT:download-formats.adoc#simple[simple download â€“ term definitions] for the terms (columns) available in the GBIF data exported to public cloud providers.  Some useful SQL expressions are described below.

.Useful SQL expressions
|====
|Meaning |Example |Expression

|GBIF species key and species name |`2878688`, `Quercus robur` |`speciesKey, species`
|Year and month |`2024-2` |`CONCAT_WS('-', year, month)`
|Year, month and day |`2024-2-1` |`CONCAT_WS('-', year, month, day)`
|A default value |`NOT-SUPPLIED` |`COALESCE(establishmentMeans, 'NOT-SUPPLIED')`
|First array value |`C. Darwin` |`identifiedBy.array_element[0]`
|Temporal uncertainty |`86400` |`temporalUncertainty(eventDate)`

=== Execute the query

Run the query.  You can download the results using the user interface.

=== Sampling bias

To account for sampling bias, the specification recommends including an occurrence count for a higher taxon, typically the family.  This can be done using an SQL _window function_.  This is a more advanced SQL technique, see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html[the PostgreSQL documentation] which has a good introduction to the concept.

The query is the same as before, except for the addition of the highlighted rows.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  -- Dimensions:
  CONCAT_WS('-', year, month) AS yearMonth,
  eeaCellCode(
    1000,
    decimalLatitude,
    decimalLongitude,
    COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000)
  ) AS eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  family, <1>
  species,
  -- Measurements
  COUNT(*) AS n,
  MIN(COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000)) AS minCoordinateUncertaintyInMeters,
  -- Higher taxon measurement
  IF(ISNULL(family), NULL, SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY family)) AS familyCount <2>
FROM
  gbif.occurrence
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
  AND countryCode = 'PL'
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdom = 'Animalia'
  AND decimalLatitude IS NOT NULL
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue.array_element, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND month IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  yearMonth,
  eeaCellCode,
  speciesKey,
  family, <3>
  species
ORDER BY
  yearMonth DESC,
  eeaCellCode ASC,
  speciesKey ASC;
----
<1> Family added to the dimensions
<2> The count by family, see explanation below.
<3> Family must be added to the group by clause.

The `familyCount` expression has two parts.

* `IF(ISNULL(family), NULL, _windowexpression_)` sets the value to `NULL` if the family itself is `NULL`.
* The window expression is `++SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY family)++`.  This partitions (groups) the result rows by family, and for each partition it sums the number of occurrences, `++SUM(COUNT(*))++`.

====

WARNING: Special care is required when generating a cube with a taxon filter of lower rank than the higher taxon count, for example when filtering for particular genera or species but using a count of occurrences in the whole family.

In this case, the WHERE clause excludes data that must be counted in the higher taxon count.  The cube must be generated in two steps.  First, a cube encompassing the whole higher taxon is generated, and then the unwanted rows are discarded.

.Two-step cube example (click to expand)

====
As with the previous example, this cube will use observations from Lichtenstein since 2000.  The filter is for a particular genus, _Cortinarius_, which is narrower than the required higher taxon count by family.

  SELECT
    -- Dimensions:
    year,
    speciesKey,
    family,
    genus,

    COUNT(*) AS count,
    -- Higher taxon for sampling bias
    IF(ISNULL(family), NULL, SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (PARTITION BY family)) AS familyCount
  FROM
    gbif.occurrence
  WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT'
    AND countryCode = 'LI'
    AND year >= 2000
    AND kingdom = 'Fungi' <2>

== Generating cube metadata

Part of the metadata is the SQL query used above.  As this is prototype software, a DOI is not assigned.

The contributions of GBIF-mediated datasets can be determined with a second SQL query, using the WHERE clause of the first. In effect, this is a two-dimensional "cube".

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
  -- Dimensions:
  datasetKey,
  license,
  -- Measurement
  COUNT(*) AS n
FROM
  gbif.occurrence
WHERE occurrenceStatus = 'PRESENT' <1>
  AND countryCode = 'PL'
  AND year >= 2000
  AND kingdom = 'Animalia'
  AND decimalLatitude IS NOT NULL
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue.array_element, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
  AND month IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  datasetKey,
  license;
----
<1> _Exactly_ the same WHERE clause as used for the cube.

The overall licence for the data is the most-strict of the licences returned in this SQL query.  From least- to most-strict, these are:
