= Get started

GBIF has developed technical documentation spread across 5 topics (should eventually be links + graphics perhaps?):

* Data publishing
** The topic is relevant for new as well as experienced data publishers in GBIF
* GBIF data processing & quality checks
** This section describes what happens to the data after you publish to GBIF and the efforts GBIF makes to standardze and clean the data for ease of use
* Data use
** How to get the data you want from GBIF and how to process it
* API
** Everything you need to know about the APIs GBIF use and how you can use them too!
* Other GBIF services
** Registry, grscicoll, vocabulary server etc.
