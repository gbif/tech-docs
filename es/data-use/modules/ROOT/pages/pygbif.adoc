= pygbif

_An interface to the GBIF API for the Python programming language._

**pygbif** is a Python package that allows searching and retrieving data from GBIF. pygbif wraps Python code around the xref:api-introduction.adoc[GBIF API] to allow you to talk to GBIF from Python and access metadata, species names, and occurrences.

The main pygbif documentation can be found at https://pygbif.readthedocs.io/.

== Installation

.Installing the stable version from PyPI
[source, python]
----
pip install pygbif
----

.Installing the development version
[source, python]
----
pip install git+git://github.com/gbif/pygbif.git#egg=pygbif
----

== Getting Started

(Based on the example from https://pygbif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/usecases.html[the documentation].)

First, load the library:

[source, python]
----
from pygbif import species as species
from pygbif import occurrences as occ
----

Look up GBIF backbone taxonomic keys from a list of names:

[source, python]
----
splist = ['Cyanocitta stelleri', 'Junco hyemalis', 'Aix sponsa',
  'Ursus americanus', 'Pinus conorta', 'Poa annuus']
keys = [ species.name_backbone(x)['usageKey'] for x in splist ]
----

Then, get a count of occurrence records for each taxon, and pull out number of records found for each taxon:

[source, python]
----
out = [ occ.search(taxonKey = x, limit=0)['count'] for x in keys ]
----

Make a dict of species names and number of records, sorting in descending order:

[source, python]
----
x = dict(zip(splist, out))
sorted(x.items(), key=lambda z:z[1], reverse=True)
----

== Citation

Under the terms of the GBIF data user agreement, users who download data agree to cite a DOI. Please see GBIFâ€™s https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines[citation guidelines].

// TODO: A method like rgbif has to aid citation and creating a derived dataset.

Please also cite pygbif.
