#.  === Desired feedback 
#.  The current UI isn't meant to be a finished product. There are many missing features that we are well aware of. We appreciate feedback about the UI, and it is almost impossible to avoid, but we are much more interested in the qestions below. 
#.  Desired feedback during the pilot phase:
#.  * Were there any rules that you wanted to make but could not?
#.  * Do you think you will be able to use the rules you made to create an improved and useful dataset?
#.  * Is there any controlled vocabulary that you would like to add?
#.  * Was it clear what you were doing and why?
#.  * Did you find the seeded rules useful? 
#.  Less interesting feedback but still appreciated:
#.  * UI improvements
#.  * Software bugs

msgid "Every occurrence record in GBIF goes through a series of processing steps prior to being made available on GBIF.org. The goal of this processing is to increase the consistency, discoverability and usability for GBIF end users. During processing and data normalization, GBIF may apply https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-use/occurrence-issues-and-flags[flags] to highlight changes or issues to both end users and publishers. All unprocessed verbatim data is available to end users via Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) downloads."

msgid "In addition to DwC-A, GBIF supports crawling of the XML-based BioCASe, TAPIR and DiGIR protocols. The outcome of any crawling regardless of its protocol is a set of https://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/5008878796/fragment[fragments] each representing a single occurrence record in its raw form. There are many billions of fragments in GBIF’s internal fragment table. In the case of Darwin Core Archives, this is a JSON representation of an entire star record: a single core record with all the related extension records attached. In the case of the XML protocols, a fragment is the exact piece of XML that we have extracted. Each protocol and content schema (ABCD1.2, ABCD2.06, DwC1.0, DwC1.4, ...) therefore still exposes its entire content and nature. For example, here are fragments of ABCD2.06 and Darwin Core."

msgid "An important part of GBIF data processing is to assign a stable `gbifID` to each new record. This is a somewhat complex process that uses the `occurrenceID`, `catalogNumber`, `collectionCode`, and `institutionCode` in combination with the GBIF datasetkey to either mint a new identifier or reuse an existing one. When publishers do not supply an occurrenceID, GBIF processing will construct an identifier using the so-called triplet code (`catalogNumber`, `collectionCode` and `institutionCode`)."
