#.  === Desired feedback
#.  The current UI isn't meant to be a finished product. There are many missing features that we are well aware of. We appreciate feedback about the UI, and it is almost impossible to avoid, but we are much more interested in the qestions below.
#.  Desired feedback during the pilot phase:
#.  * Were there any rules that you wanted to make but could not?
#.  * Do you think you will be able to use the rules you made to create an improved and useful dataset?
#.  * Is there any controlled vocabulary that you would like to add?
#.  * Was it clear what you were doing and why?
#.  * Did you find the seeded rules useful?
#.  Less interesting feedback but still appreciated:
#.  * UI improvements
#.  * Software bugs

"Every occurrence record in GBIF goes through a series of processing steps "
"prior to being made available on GBIF.org. The goal of this processing is to "
"increase the consistency, discoverability and usability for GBIF end users. "
"During processing and data normalization, GBIF may apply xref:data-use::"
"occurrence-issues-and-flags[flags] to highlight changes or issues to both "
"end users and publishers. All unprocessed verbatim data is available to end "
"users via Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) downloads."

"The first processing step is to harvest data from the service endpoint "

"In addition to DwC-A, GBIF supports crawling of the XML-based BioCASe, TAPIR "
"and DiGIR protocols. The outcome of any crawling regardless of its protocol "
"is a set of https://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/5008878796/"
"fragment[fragments] each representing a single occurrence record in its raw "
"form. There are many billions of fragments in GBIF’s internal fragment "
"table. In the case of Darwin Core Archives, this is a JSON representation of "
"an entire star record: a single core record with all the related extension "
"records attached. In the case of the XML protocols, a fragment is the exact "
"piece of XML that we have extracted. Each protocol and content schema "
"(ABCD1.2, ABCD2.06, DwC1.0, DwC1.4, ...) therefore still exposes its entire "
"content and nature. For example, here are fragments of ABCD2.06 and Darwin "
