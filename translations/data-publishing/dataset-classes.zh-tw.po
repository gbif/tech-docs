msgid "At its simplest level, institutions can create datasets describing unavailable resources like undigitized natural history collections. The other dataset classes include this basic information, but this ‘metadata-only’ class offers users a valuable tool for discovering and learning about evidence not yet available online or could be accessed in other places than GBIF. Metadata-only datasets can also help assess the relative importance and value of undigitized collections and set priorities for future digitization. As with all datasets, GBIF ensures that each metadata dataset is associated with a unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to streamline data users’ citation of these resources."

msgid "Checklists are catalogues or lists of named organisms, or taxa. While they may include additional details like local species names or specimen citations, these ‘checklists’ typically categorize information along taxonomic, geographic, and thematic lines or some combination of the three. For example, a dataset that catalogues the Red Listed molluscs of Seychelles has distinct elements of taxonomy (the phylum Mollusca), geography (the island nation of Seychelles) and theme (species deemed imperilled by IUCN experts). Checklists function as a rapid summary or baseline inventory of taxa in a given context."

Occurrence datasets are the core of data published through GBIF.org, and examples can range from specimens and fossils in natural history collections, observations by field researchers and citizen scientists, and data gathered from camera traps or remote-sensing satellites."
