"GBIF will integrate the Local Contexts (LC) API to access and retrieve LC "
"identifiers and URLs associated with GBIF-mediated datasets. Through this "
"integration, GBIF will ensure that Local Contexts Projects, Labels, and "
"Notices are correctly linked and displayed across its data infrastructure, "
"supporting the visibility of Indigenous data governance information.  "
"Specifically, GBIF will use the LC API to get and maintain up-to-date LC "
"identifiers and URLs that are referenced in published datasets. These data "
"will then be surfaced through GBIFâ€™s main delivery services: GBIF Data "
"Portal: LC information will be displayed on dataset and occurrence pages, "
"providing direct links to relevant Local Contexts Projects, Labels, or "
"Notices."

"In addition to API-based integration, GBIF will also consume self-contained "
"datasets; that is, datasets that already include the relevant LC "
"identifiers, metadata, and links within their published data. In such cases, "
"GBIF will not need to access the LC API or related data services directly; "
"instead, it will preserve and display the embedded LC information as part of "
"its standard data publishing workflow."

"This pilot aims to promote the integration of *LocalContexts Notices* and "
"Labels within the https://www.gbif.org/[GBIF] data publishing framework.  "
"This work focuses on engaging existing GBIF publishers to publish datasets "
"in which the underlying data is explicitly connected to *Traditional "
"Knowledge (TK)*, *Cultural Heritage*, or other Indigenous-related contexts "
"linked to *geographic scope, species identification, specimen collection, "
"and data use conditions.*"

"The main objective of this pilot is to demonstrate how a subset of GBIF "
"publishers can enrich their data with *https://localcontexts.org/"
"[LocalContexts] identifiers (Notices, Labels, and Projects)*, and to explore "
"how these identifiers can be obtained and visualized through the *GBIF API, "
"IPT (Integrated Publishing Toolkit), and GBIF.org data portal.*"
