"Several issues concerning coordinates are encountered frequently. While the "
"indexing process makes efforts to identify such cases and propose "
"corrections, e.g. by plausibility-testing coordinates against country names, "
"attention is needed already at the level of data preparation and "
"publication. Such issues include transformation errors (resulting from e.g. "
"conversion of degrees-minutes-seconds into decimal values), accidental "
"swapping of values, either in the dataset or during the mapping process "
"(latitude and longitude are reversed), or negation of values (transposition "
"of locations from north to south, east to west or vice versa through the "
"accidental or systematic loss or addition of minus-values). Additional "
"points to keep in mind during data preparation are technical defaults (e.g. "
"database settings substituting 0-values instead of unknown values resulting "
"in records supplying lat/long as `0/0`; over-precision of data by automatic "
"number-padding (`lat -17.79200000` where `lat -17.792` would be "
"appropriate), or the need to blur coordinate precision e.g. the protection "
"of sensitive species. Also note that gridded data, i.e. where coordinates "
"represent centroids of grid cells in a field survey rather than the actual "
"occurrence locality, may be better represented by publishing the dataset as "
"event data rather than as occurrence records. Especially in such cases, it "
"is essential also to supply the <<coordinateUncertaintyInMeters>>."
