#.  === Desired feedback
#.  The current UI isn't meant to be a finished product. There are many missing features that we are well aware of. We appreciate feedback about the UI, and it is almost impossible to avoid, but we are much more interested in the qestions below.
#.  Desired feedback during the pilot phase:
#.  * Were there any rules that you wanted to make but could not?
#.  * Do you think you will be able to use the rules you made to create an improved and useful dataset?
#.  * Is there any controlled vocabulary that you would like to add?
#.  * Was it clear what you were doing and why?
#.  * Did you find the seeded rules useful?
#.  Less interesting feedback but still appreciated:
#.  * UI improvements
#.  * Software bugs

#.  === Focus on location
#.  We've made a deliberate choice to concentrate on *location* rule-based annotations for biodiversity occurrences. This decision stems from our goal to streamline and focus our efforts while addressing the most https://github.com/gbif/portal-feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+location+[a prevalent type of feedback we receive at GBIF].
#.  It's important to note, however, that the concept of rule-based annotations is inherently extensible. While our initial focus centres on location data, the same framework and principles can be applied to other areas of data quality improvement within the GBIF context. This adaptability allows us to remain responsive to evolving user needs and feedback, ensuring that our efforts can be broadened to encompass other data quality challenges in the future. Ultimately, our aim is to create a flexible and scalable solution that can continue to benefit the biodiversity community as a whole.
#.  === Comparison with similar projects
#.  Other efforts exist to catalogue the ranges of the living world:
#.  * https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download[IUCN range maps]
#.  * https://mol.org/[Map of life]
#.  * https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/atlases[iNaturalist atlases]
#.  While these efforts are useful and well-developed, none of them are expressly focused on data quality. Namely, none of these systems allow users to easily state with a simple controlled vocabulary and rules where occurrences for a species are likely and unlikely.
#.  .Our system allows users to annotate at an granular scale. For example, this annotation marks all occurrences that happen to be near this greenhouse as "managed".

#.  ==== Rule extensions
#.  We have found in initial testing that only being able to annotate land areas (a geo-polygon) is restrictive, so it is anticipated that certain extensions to this basic formula might be supported.
#.  For example, often occurrence records can be suspicious but still be in a somewhat plausible location. A natural way to handle such cases would be to allow for rules with GBIF `datasetKey`.
#.  `rule` ->  `taxon` in `geo-polygon` and `datasetKey` are `controlled vocab`
#.  For example,
#.  `rule` -> *Lions* in *South Africa* and *datasetKey* are *suspicious*
#.  Another natural extension might be GBIF `basisOfRecord`.
#.  For example, https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/country-centroids/[country centroid] locations are often only suspicious for museum specimens, so a user could define a rule that captures this knowledge.
#.  `rule` -> *Lions* in *Centroid of South Africa* and *Preserved Specimen* are *suspicious*
#.  "Centroid of South Africa" would, of course, be defined by some WKT object like a circle or a polygon.
#.  Finally, there might be other fields that might make good qualifiers/extensions, like `year`.

#.  === Sharing rules
#.  It is also anticipated that a desirable feature would allow users to "borrow" `rule` or geo-polygon from another `ruleset` and assign a new taxonKey or add a rule extension. This will reduce the storage strains on GBIF and prevent duplicate work.
#.  For example, a common `rule` might be to mark something in the ocean as suspicious. A user should be able apply this rule to a new taxonKey without creating a new ocean polygon every time.
#.  === Exceptions to rules
#.  Creating cast-down annotations can be hard due to several reasons related to the nature of the task and **exceptions to the rule**. An exclusion rule could be efficient for higher level downcasting of rules.
#.  For example, a rule could exclude a certain group
#.  `rule` -> `taxon` in `geo-polygon` are `controlled vocabulary` except `taxon x`
#.  `rule` -> *Amphibians* in *Antarctica* are *Suspicious* except **Antartic frogs**
